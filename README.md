# Sewer Hell

Sewer Hell is an Immersive Survival Horror VR game inspired by games such as Into the Radius, Saints & Sinners and Rotten Flesh.

It is contains extraction mechanics where on the map you have a safe space where items don't respawn.
Every 30 minutes the sewer floods and every item and enemy on the map respawns, however some things such as unlocked doors stay open.

Sewer Hell was created for the S&Box Game Jam II, a 30 day game jam for the s&box game engine.
